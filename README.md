### Business Introduction
Global Superstores Ltd. operates within the retail and e-commerce industry, a highly competitive and data-driven sector where customer satisfaction, profitability, and operational efficiency are essential for sustained growth. With globalization and digitization reshaping consumer behavior, the ability to track and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) across geographies and product lines is a strategic necessity.

### Business Problem
Despite achieving $1.47M in profit and fulfilling over 51K orders, several cities and regions (notably Nigeria and certain U.S. cities) are operating at a loss, and shipping costs vary drastically across sub-categories and regions. This dashboard seeks to answer:
Where is the company gaining or losing profit, and why? How can product and logistics decisions be optimized to improve performance?
